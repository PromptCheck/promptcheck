# EvalLoop YAML Reference

_Coming Soon!_

This document will provide a detailed reference for all configurable fields in the `tests/*.yaml` files and the `evalloop.config.yaml` file.

For now, please refer to:
*   The [Quick-Start Guide](quickstart.md)
*   The examples in the [`example/tests/`](../example/tests/) directory.
*   The Pydantic schemas in `src/evalloop/core/schemas.py` for the most precise definitions.
